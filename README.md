# SQL-PROJECTS
I decided to analyze the database for a DVD rental company we will call Rent A Film. Let’s take a look at a case study detailing my process and output.

Data-set
I began by taking a look at the database. The database DvdRental has 15 tables. Below are the different tables and a brief description of them.

actor — contains actors data including first name and last name.
film — contains films data such as title, release year, length, rating, etc.
film_actor — contains the relationships between films and actors.
category — contains film’s categories data.
film_category — containing the relationships between films and categories.
store — contains the store data including manager staff and address.
inventory — stores inventory data.
rental — stores rental data.

staff — stores staff data.
customer — stores customer’s data.
